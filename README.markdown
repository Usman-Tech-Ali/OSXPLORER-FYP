# OSXplorer 🧠⚙️

*A Gamified Learning Platform for Operating Systems Concepts*\
**🚧 Work in Progress – Currently in Iteration 1 (Frontend Development)**

---

## 📌 Overview

**OSXplorer** is an interactive, gamified Learning Management System (LMS) built to make Operating Systems (OS) concepts fun, intuitive, and engaging for students. Through progressive 2D games and a dynamic learning dashboard, OSXplorer breaks down complex topics like CPU Scheduling, Memory Management, and Process Synchronization into multi-level interactive challenges.

The platform is designed with:

- Real-time visual simulations
- Gamified progression (XP, badges, quests, leaderboards)
- A planned AI-powered assistant to guide users and troubleshoot OS topics
- Accessibility and engagement as core principles

> Developed as the Final Year Project (FYP) for BS Software Engineering, FAST NUCES, 2022.

## 🎮 Modules

1. **Scheduler Dash** – Learn CPU Scheduling (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority, RR) via lane-based simulations
2. **Memory Stackers** – Practice memory allocation (First Fit, Best Fit, Paging, etc.) via puzzle-style interaction
3. **Critical Chase** – Explore Process Synchronization (Mutex, Semaphores, Deadlocks) with path-based logic games

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First-time Setup

If you haven't already installed the dependencies:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family by Vercel.
